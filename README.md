Revenue-Maximization

This study addresses the problem of optimizing the placement of multiple advertisements on a web banner, where the price of an ad varies based on its position on the banner. The problem is modeled as a two-dimensional orthogonal knapsack problem with a pixel-based pricing model. Given that the problem is NP-complete, a solution balancing efficiency and effectiveness is required. Experimental results demonstrate that significant improvements in advertising banner performance can be achieved by adopting position-based pricing models, thereby increasing revenue for website owners.
